            Kalki (Sanskrit: कल्कि), also called Kalkin, is the prophesied tenth and final incarnation of the god
            Vishnu. He is described to appear in order to end the Kali Yuga, one of the four periods in the endless
            cycle of existence (Krita) in Vaishnava cosmology. The end of the Kali Yuga states this will usher in the
            new epoch of Satya Yuga in the cycle of existence, until the Mahapralaya (dissolution of the
            universe).

            Kalki is described in the Puranas as the avatar who rejuvenates existence by ending the darkest and
            destructive period to remove adharma (unrighteousness) and ushering in the Satya Yuga, while riding a white
            horse with a fiery sword. The description and details of Kalki are different among various Puranas. Kalki
            is also found in Buddhist texts, for example the Kalachakra-Tantra of Tibetan Buddhism.

                <h2>Etymology</h2>
                <p>The name Kalki is derived from Kal, which means "time" (Kali Yuga). The original term may have
                    been Karki (white, from the horse) which morphed into Kalki. This proposal is supported by two
                    versions of Mahabharata manuscripts that have been found, where the
                    Sanskrit verses name the incarnation to be karki.</p>

            <h1>Description</h1>
            <p>Kalki is an avatara of Vishnu. Avatar means "descent", and refers to a descent of the divine into the
                material realm of human existence. The Garuda Purana lists ten incarnations, with Kalki being the final
                one. He is described as the incarnation who appears at the end of the Kali Yuga. He ends the
                darkest, degenerating, and chaotic stage of the Kali Yuga to remove adharma and ushers in the Satya
                Yuga, while riding a white horse with a fiery sword.He restarts a new cycle of time.</p>
